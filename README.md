# StudentPerformance

The Student Performance dataset is downloaded from Kaggle Student Performance in Exams (https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams). It consists of 1000 observations on 8 separate variables. 5 columns are categorical, and 3 columns are numeric variables. The variables include:

•	Gender Ethnicity 
•	Parental level of Education
•	Lunch 
•	Test preparation course 
•	Math score 
•	Reading score 
•	Writing score

The inspiration is to understand the influence of the student's background and determine the features which play an essential role in affecting academic performance. The background has to do with their ethnicity, education level of their parents and the type of lunch they have. Other innate characteristics deemed relevant for the students’ performance is the gender, whether they had completed a preparatory course before taking the tests. The students’ performance is gauged on their scores obtained in the reading, writing and math tests.
